# Typewriter Effect for Basic Models - Subproject 3

## Overview

This implementation adds a typewriter effect for basic models (models without vision, tools, or reasoning capabilities) in the multi-host deployment configuration (subproject 3). When a basic model is selected, the UI displays the streamed response from the model as it comes, using a typewriter effect that shows text appearing in real-time as the model generates it.

## Features

### 1. Basic Model Detection
- A model is considered "basic" if all of the following capabilities are `false`:
  - `vision`: false
  - `tools`: false  
  - `reasoning`: false

### 2. Streaming API Endpoint
- **New endpoint**: `POST /api/chat/stream`
- **Purpose**: Provides Server-Sent Events (SSE) streaming for basic models
- **Validation**: Only allows streaming for basic models; returns error for advanced models
- **Events**: 
  - `connected`: Stream connection established
  - `conversation`: Conversation info (for new conversations)
  - `thinking`: Model is processing the request
  - `streaming_start`: Response generation has started
  - `token`: Individual token from the model (includes current accumulated content)
  - `streaming_end`: Response generation completed
  - `complete`: Final message with metadata
  - `error`: Error occurred during streaming

### 3. Enhanced Client-Side Implementation

#### API Service (`api.ts`)
- **New method**: `sendMessageStreaming()` - handles streaming requests using fetch API with ReadableStream
- **Validation**: Checks if model is basic before attempting to stream
- **Event handling**: Parses SSE events and calls provided callback function

#### DivineDialog Component (`index.tsx`)
- **Smart routing**: Automatically detects basic models and uses streaming API
- **Fallback**: Advanced models continue to use traditional REST API
- **UI indicator**: Shows "Streaming Enabled" badge for basic models
- **Real-time updates**: Handles streaming events to update UI state

#### MessageList Component (`MessageList.tsx`)
- **Streaming display**: Shows streaming content with typewriter effect
- **Status indicators**: Different labels for "thinking", "streaming", and "typing" states
- **TypewriterText integration**: Uses enhanced TypewriterText component for display

#### TypewriterText Component (`TypewriterText.tsx`)
- **Streaming mode**: New `isStreaming` prop for immediate display with cursor
- **Dual behavior**:
  - **Traditional**: Character-by-character animation for saved messages
  - **Streaming**: Immediate display with blinking cursor for live content
- **Cursor animation**: CSS-based blinking cursor with proper text alignment

### 4. Visual Features
- **Streaming indicator**: Green badge showing "Streaming Enabled" for basic models
- **Animated cursor**: Blinking cursor (▌) appears at the end of streaming text
- **Real-time display**: Text appears immediately as tokens are received
- **Smooth transitions**: Seamless transition from thinking → streaming → complete states

## Technical Implementation

### Server-Side Changes
```typescript
// New streaming endpoint in chat.ts
router.post('/stream', async (req, res, next) => {
  // Validates model is basic
  const capabilities = await getModelCapabilitiesWithFallback(model);
  if (!isBasicModel(capabilities)) {
    throw new AppError(400, 'Streaming only available for basic models');
  }
  
  // Sets up Server-Sent Events
  res.writeHead(200, {
    'Content-Type': 'text/event-stream',
    'Cache-Control': 'no-cache',
    'Connection': 'keep-alive'
  });
  
  // Streams tokens as they arrive
  await streamliner.streamChat(processedRequest, (token: string) => {
    assistantContent += token;
    res.write(`data: ${JSON.stringify({ 
      type: 'token', 
      token,
      content: assistantContent 
    })}\n\n`);
  });
});
```

### Client-Side Changes
```typescript
// Streaming API method in api.ts
async sendMessageStreaming(params, onEvent, capabilities) {
  if (!this.isBasicModel(capabilities)) {
    throw new Error('Streaming only available for basic models');
  }
  
  const response = await fetch('/api/chat/stream', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify(params),
  });
  
  const reader = response.body.getReader();
  // Process SSE events and call onEvent callback
}
```

```typescript
// Smart routing in DivineDialog
const isBasicModel = () => {
  if (!modelCapabilities) return false;
  return !modelCapabilities.vision && !modelCapabilities.tools && !modelCapabilities.reasoning;
};

if (isBasicModel()) {
  // Use streaming API
  await api.sendMessageStreaming(params, onEvent, modelCapabilities);
} else {
  // Use traditional API
  await api.sendMessage(params);
}
```

### Enhanced TypewriterText Component
```typescript
// Streaming mode with immediate display
if (isStreaming) {
  setDisplayedContent(content);  // Show immediately
  setIsTyping(true);            // Keep cursor visible
  return;
}
```

## User Experience

### Basic Models (Streaming Enabled)
1. **Visual indicator**: Green "Streaming Enabled" badge appears
2. **Real-time response**: Text appears immediately as model generates it
3. **Typewriter effect**: Blinking cursor shows active generation
4. **Smooth flow**: thinking → streaming → complete states

### Advanced Models (Traditional)
1. **Standard flow**: thinking → complete (with post-generation typewriter effect)
2. **Full capabilities**: Vision, tools, and reasoning features remain available
3. **Backwards compatible**: No changes to existing functionality

## Configuration

### Multi-Host Deployment (Subproject 3)
This feature is specifically designed for subproject 3 and is automatically enabled when:
- Model capabilities are successfully detected
- Selected model has no advanced capabilities (vision, tools, reasoning)
- Streaming endpoint is available

### Environment Variables
No additional environment variables required. Feature uses existing:
- `MODEL_CAPABILITY_MODE` - controls how model capabilities are detected
- Standard multi-host deployment configuration

## Benefits

1. **Enhanced UX**: Real-time feedback makes the application feel more responsive
2. **Visual Appeal**: Typewriter effect creates engaging user experience
3. **Performance**: Streaming reduces perceived latency for basic models
4. **Smart Routing**: Automatically optimizes based on model capabilities
5. **Backwards Compatible**: Advanced models retain full functionality
6. **Resource Efficient**: Only basic models use streaming to minimize server load

## Testing

### Test Scenarios
1. **Basic Model Selection**: 
   - Select a basic model (no capabilities)
   - Verify "Streaming Enabled" indicator appears
   - Send message and confirm real-time streaming

2. **Advanced Model Selection**:
   - Select model with capabilities (vision/tools/reasoning)
   - Verify traditional API is used
   - Confirm all advanced features work

3. **Model Switching**:
   - Switch between basic and advanced models
   - Verify appropriate API is used for each

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Test streaming interruption
   - Verify graceful fallback to traditional API

## Future Enhancements

1. **Configurable Speed**: Allow users to adjust typewriter speed
2. **Audio Effects**: Optional typing sound effects
3. **Advanced Models**: Explore streaming for models with capabilities
4. **Mobile Optimization**: Enhance mobile experience for streaming
5. **Performance Metrics**: Track streaming performance and user engagement

## Compatibility

- **Subproject 3**: Multi-host deployment ✅
- **Subproject 1**: Same-host with Ollama container (not implemented)
- **Subproject 2**: Same-host with existing Ollama (not implemented)
- **Browsers**: Modern browsers with fetch and ReadableStream support
- **Models**: All basic models (no vision, tools, or reasoning capabilities)
