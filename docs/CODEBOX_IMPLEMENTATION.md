# CodeBlock Component Implementation

## Overview
Enhanced CodeBlock component with advanced syntax highlighting and copy-to-clipboard functionality for subproject 3 (Multi-host deployment). When the LLM generates code, it is now displayed in a beautifully styled codebox with language-specific syntax highlighting and a copy button positioned in the bottom right corner.

## ✅ Fixed Implementation (June 2025)
The syntax highlighting issue has been resolved! The previous implementation had custom style overrides that were preventing the syntax highlighting colors from being applied properly. This has been fixed and the component now displays proper color-coded syntax highlighting.

## Files Modified/Added

### 1. `packages/client/src/components/ui/codeblock.tsx` (FIXED & ENHANCED)
A React component that wraps code blocks with advanced syntax highlighting and copy functionality:

**Features:**
- **✅ Working Syntax Highlighting**: Uses react-syntax-highlighter with Prism for language-specific color coding
- **Multi-Language Support**: Automatically detects and highlights JavaScript, Python, TypeScript, CSS, HTML, JSON, Bash, and many more languages
- **Dark Theme Integration**: Enhanced oneDark theme consistent with existing UI design
- **Copy-to-Clipboard**: Button in bottom right corner (visible on hover)
- **Smart Language Detection**: Extracts language from className (e.g., "language-javascript")
- **Fallback Support**: Gracefully handles unsupported languages as plain text
- **Modern Clipboard API**: With fallback for older browsers
- **Proper Accessibility**: aria-labels for screen readers
- **Visual Feedback**: Shows checkmark icon for 2 seconds after copying

**Language Support:**
- JavaScript, TypeScript, JSX, TSX
- Python, Java, C++, C#, Go, Rust
- HTML, CSS, SCSS, Sass
- JSON, YAML, XML
- Bash, Shell, PowerShell
- SQL, GraphQL
- Markdown, and many more

**Key Implementation Details:**
- Uses `react-syntax-highlighter` with Prism for optimal performance
- **FIXED**: Enhanced oneDark theme that preserves syntax highlighting token colors
- **FIXED**: Removed custom style overrides that were preventing color application
- Language extraction from ReactMarkdown className
- Robust text content extraction from React children
- Hover-based copy button with smooth transitions
- Consistent with existing Button component styling

**Previous Issue & Resolution:**
The previous implementation had a `customOneDarkStyle` object that was overriding the syntax highlighting colors from the `oneDark` theme. This caused all code to appear in the same gray color regardless of the programming language. The fix involved:
1. Replacing the problematic custom style object with an enhanced version
2. Preserving all syntax highlighting token colors from the oneDark theme
3. Maintaining consistent styling with the application's dark theme
4. Ensuring proper color application for different code elements

### 2. `packages/client/src/components/DivineDialog/MessageItem.tsx` (EXISTING)
The message rendering component already integrates with the enhanced CodeBlock:

**Integration:**
- ReactMarkdown automatically passes language information via className
- Code blocks are rendered with proper syntax highlighting
- Maintains existing inline code styling for non-block code
- Seamless integration with existing chat message flow

### 3. `packages/client/package.json` (UPDATED)
Dependencies for syntax highlighting are properly configured:

**Dependencies:**
- `react-syntax-highlighter`: ^15.5.0 - Core syntax highlighting library
- `@types/react-syntax-highlighter`: ^15.5.11 - TypeScript definitions

## Usage
The enhanced features automatically activate when:
1. The LLM generates a response containing code blocks
2. The code is formatted with markdown code block syntax (triple backticks with optional language)
3. ReactMarkdown renders the content and passes language information
4. The CodeBlock component detects the language and applies appropriate highlighting

## User Experience
- **✅ Working Language Detection**: Automatic language detection from markdown code blocks
- **✅ Working Color-Coded Syntax**: Keywords, strings, comments, numbers, and operators now display in proper colors
- **Better Readability**: Improved code comprehension with visual differentiation
- **Hover State**: Copy button appears when hovering over code blocks
- **Copy Action**: Click the copy button to copy code to clipboard
- **Visual Feedback**: Button shows checkmark icon for 2 seconds after copying
- **Accessibility**: Proper aria-labels for screen readers
- **Consistent Theming**: Dark theme that matches the application design

## Technical Stack
- **Syntax Highlighting**: react-syntax-highlighter with Prism
- **Theme**: Enhanced oneDark theme with application-specific styling
- **Icons**: Lucide React (Copy, Check)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with existing design tokens
- **Clipboard**: Navigator Clipboard API with document.execCommand fallback
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript

## Color Scheme (Now Working!)
The syntax highlighting now properly displays a carefully selected color palette:
- **Keywords**: `#ff79c6` (Pink) - for language keywords like `function`, `class`, `if`
- **Strings**: `#f1fa8c` (Yellow) - for string literals
- **Comments**: `#6272a4` (Blue-gray) - for code comments
- **Numbers**: `#bd93f9` (Purple) - for numeric values
- **Functions**: `#8be9fd` (Cyan) - for function names
- **Properties**: `#50fa7b` (Green) - for object properties
- **Operators**: `#ff79c6` (Pink) - for operators like `+`, `-`, `=`
- **Variables**: `#f8f8f2` (White) - for variable names
- **Background**: `#1f2937` (Gray-800) - consistent with application theme

## Performance
- **Optimized Bundle**: Uses ESM imports for tree-shaking
- **Language Loading**: Only loads syntax definitions as needed
- **Efficient Rendering**: Prism provides fast syntax parsing
- **Minimal Impact**: Small bundle size increase for significant UX improvement

## Browser Support
- Modern browsers: Uses Navigator Clipboard API
- Legacy browsers: Falls back to document.execCommand
- All major browsers supported for syntax highlighting
- Graceful degradation for unsupported features

## Troubleshooting

### If Syntax Highlighting Isn't Working:
1. **Check Language Detection**: Ensure code blocks use proper markdown syntax with language specification:
   ```
   ```javascript
   const example = "Hello World";
   ```
   ```

2. **Verify Dependencies**: Ensure react-syntax-highlighter is properly installed:
   ```bash
   npm list react-syntax-highlighter
   ```

3. **Check Import Paths**: Verify the imports in codeblock.tsx are correct:
   ```typescript
   import { Prism as SyntaxHighlighter } from 'react-syntax-highlighter';
   import { oneDark } from 'react-syntax-highlighter/dist/esm/styles/prism';
   ```

4. **Clear Cache**: If using development server, clear cache and restart:
   ```bash
   npm run dev -- --force
   ```

### Common Issues & Solutions:
- **Gray Text Only**: This was the main issue that has been fixed. If you still see only gray text, ensure you have the latest version of the component.
- **Copy Button Not Visible**: Check hover state by moving mouse over the code block
- **Language Not Detected**: Ensure proper markdown language tag (e.g., `javascript`, `python`, `typescript`)

## Subproject Scope
This enhanced implementation is specifically for **subproject 3 (Multi-host deployment)** and maintains consistency with the existing UI components and design system used in that deployment configuration.

## Future Enhancements
Potential future improvements could include:
- Line numbers for longer code blocks
- Code folding for very large blocks
- Additional language support as needed
- Custom theme switching options
- Search within code blocks
- Diff highlighting for code comparisons

## Testing
To test the syntax highlighting:
1. Start a conversation with the AI
2. Ask for code examples in different languages
3. Verify that keywords, strings, and other elements display in different colors
4. Test the copy functionality by hovering and clicking the copy button
5. Verify proper language detection for common languages like JavaScript, Python, TypeScript, etc.
