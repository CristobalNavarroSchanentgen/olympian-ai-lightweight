# Artifact State Synchronization Fix

## Issue Description
When switching between conversations, the artifact functionality was experiencing state synchronization issues:

1. **Artifacts from previous conversations remained selected** - causing wrong artifacts to display
2. **Code blocks appeared in chat instead of artifacts** - when artifacts were missing or invalid
3. **Artifact panel showed wrong content** - displaying artifacts from previous conversations
4. **No proper cleanup of artifact state** - when switching conversations

## Root Cause Analysis
The core issue was that **artifact state was not properly synchronized with conversation changes**. The artifact store maintained global state without considering conversation context during transitions.

### Key Problems:
- No clearing of `selectedArtifact` when switching conversations
- Missing validation to ensure selected artifacts belong to current conversation  
- No fallback handling when artifacts become invalid after conversation switch
- Chat content didn't revert to original (with code blocks) when artifacts were missing

## Implementation Fix

### 1. Enhanced Chat Store (`useChatStore.ts`)
- **Added artifact state clearing** in `selectConversation()` method
- **Auto-selects most recent artifact** for target conversation
- **Properly cleans up artifact state** on conversation deletion and creation
- **Uses dynamic imports** to avoid circular dependencies

### 2. Updated Conversation Sidebar (`ConversationSidebar.tsx`)
- **Immediate artifact clearing** when switching conversations
- **Intelligent artifact panel management** - opens if target conversation has artifacts
- **Preventive state clearing** before conversation switch to avoid flash of wrong content

### 3. Enhanced Artifact Panel (`ArtifactPanel.tsx`)
- **Added conversation validation** with `useEffect` hook
- **Validates selected artifact belongs to current conversation**
- **Auto-selects most recent artifact** when conversation changes
- **Improved empty state handling**

### 4. Improved Message Rendering (`MessageItem.tsx`)
- **Enhanced artifact validation** with conversation context checking
- **Fallback content display** - shows original content with code blocks when artifacts are missing
- **Visual feedback** with warning badges for missing artifacts
- **Proper error handling** and user communication

### 5. Synchronized Divine Dialog (`DivineDialog/index.tsx`)
- **Added conversation-artifact sync** via `useEffect` hook
- **Auto-opens artifact panel** when new artifacts are created
- **Proper cleanup** on new conversation creation

## Key Features

### Smart State Synchronization
- Automatically clears incompatible artifact selections
- Auto-selects relevant artifacts for new conversations
- Maintains user preferences for panel visibility

### Fallback Handling
- Shows original message content when artifacts are unavailable
- Provides clear visual feedback about missing artifacts
- Graceful degradation without breaking user experience

### Conversation Context Validation
- Ensures artifacts always belong to current conversation
- Prevents cross-conversation artifact contamination
- Maintains data integrity across conversation switches

## Testing Considerations

To verify the fix:
1. Create conversations with artifacts (code, documents, etc.)
2. Switch between conversations with and without artifacts
3. Verify artifacts display correctly for each conversation
4. Confirm code blocks appear in chat when artifacts are missing
5. Test new conversation creation and deletion

## Impact on All Subprojects

This fix applies uniformly to all three deployment subprojects:
- Same-host with Ollama container
- Same-host with existing Ollama  
- Multi-host deployment

The changes are purely frontend state management improvements and don't affect deployment configurations or backend behavior.
