# MCP Restart Loop - Final Fix

## Complete Solution Applied

### 1. Health Check Simplification
- Created `/api/multihost/health/ping` endpoint that always returns 200 OK
- This prevents Docker from restarting the container during initialization
- Original `/health/simple` endpoint still available for detailed status

### 2. Docker Configuration Changes
- Increased health check interval: 30s → 60s
- Increased health check timeout: 10s → 30s
- Increased retry count: 5 → 10
- Added 5-second delay before health check execution

### 3. Startup Wrapper Script
Created `docker/backend/startup.sh` that:
- Logs environment variables for debugging
- Creates required directories (`/app/logs/mcp`)
- Provides clear startup messaging
- Uses exec to properly handle signals

### 4. Enhanced Logging
- MCP logger writes to `/app/logs/mcp/mcp-events-*.log`
- Process watchdog tracks restarts in `/app/logs/mcp/restarts.log`
- Added detailed health check logging with uptime
- Added shutdown trigger logging with stack traces

### 5. Grace Period Extension
- Increased startup grace period from 30s to 60s
- Health check returns "starting" status during initialization
- Prevents premature failure declarations

## Verification Steps

1. Build and deploy:
   ```bash
   make quick-docker-multi
   ```

2. Monitor startup:
   ```bash
   docker logs olympian-backend-1 -f
   ```

3. Check health status:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3001/api/multihost/health/ping
   curl http://localhost:3001/api/multihost/health/simple
   ```

4. Monitor MCP events:
   ```bash
   make mcp-monitor
   ```

## Expected Behavior
- Backend starts and shows "[STARTUP WRAPPER]" messages
- Health checks pass immediately with `/health/ping`
- No restart loops occur
- MCP services initialize properly
- Logs are written to `/app/logs/mcp/`

## Debugging Commands
```bash
# View container status
docker ps -a | grep olympian

# Check restart count
docker inspect olympian-backend-1 | grep -A5 RestartCount

# View detailed logs
docker logs olympian-backend-1 --tail 100

# Check MCP diagnostics
make mcp-diagnostics
```

## Root Cause Summary
The restart loop was caused by:
1. Health check failing immediately on startup
2. Coordination service not connecting fast enough
3. Insufficient grace period for initialization
4. Health check endpoint requiring services that weren't ready

The fix ensures the container stays healthy during initialization while services start up properly.
